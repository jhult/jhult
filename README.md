### Howdy üëã

I'm a Staff Software Engineer with 13+ years of experience in software engineering, consulting, and pre-sales. I have a deep understanding of Java, Kotlin, and the Oracle Fusion Middleware stack. I have¬†years of experience in the design, development, and support of large-scale projects.

I started my IT journey in my teens by fixing computers for family and friends. During high school, I served as Technical Director for a financial advisor's office. I continued my journey by attending [Iowa State University](iastate.edu) where I graduated in 3 years with a B.S. in Management Information Systems. After college, I started working with Oracle WebCenter Content.

I am globally recognized within the WebCenter Content community. I have worked with clients around the world to help them solve their business problems. I have worked with clients in a wide variety of industries (finance, tech, non-profit, transportation, education, retail), worked on large and small projects (from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies and U.S. Federal Government agencies), and worked in varying capacities (from developer to project lead).

At [Mythics](https://www.mythics.com/), I progressed from a technical consultant to a Technical Director. I shared my Oracle expertise on the [Mythics blog](https://mythics.com/blog/) and presented at COLLABORATE, [Oracle OpenWorld](https://www.oracle.com/cloudworld/), tech days, and other events.

Today, I work as a Staff Software Engineer for [H-E-B](https://digital.heb.com/) helping track the quantity, movement, and financial value of inventory at all stores and warehouses.

Outside of my daily work, I enjoy disc golf, bowling, snow skiing, board and video games, watching movies/TV and rock music/concerts. I can play multiple instruments including piano, trumpet, and guitar. I love Jesus and worship Him at [The Austin Stone Community Church](https://austinstone.org/).
