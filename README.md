### Hi there üëã

I'm an experienced IT consultant with 9+ years of experience. I have a deep understanding of the Oracle Fusion Middleware stack, hands-on experience and years of experience in design, development, support of large-scale projects.

I started my IT journey in my teens by fixing computers for family and friends. During high school, I served as Technical Director for a financial advisor's office. I continued my journey by attending [Iowa State University](iastate.edu) where I graduated in 3 years with a B.S. in Management Information Systems. After college, I started working with Oracle WebCenter Content.

I am globally recognized within the WebCenter Content community. I have worked with clients around the world to help them solve their business problems. I have worked with clients in a wide variety of industries (finance, tech, non-profit, transportation, education, retail), worked on large and small projects (from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies and U.S. Federal Government agencies) and in varying capacities (from developer to project lead).

After coming to [Mythics](https://www.mythics.com/), I progressed from a technical consultant to a Technical Director. Today, my primary goal is to manage technical innovations which internally benefit Mythics as well as our clients. I maintain a personal and technical blog at [JonathanHult.com](https://jonathanhult.com). I also share my Oracle expertise on the [Mythics blog](https://www.mythics.com/about/blog/). I am active on Internet forums where I enjoy mentoring others. I have presented at COLLABORATE, Oracle OpenWorld, tech days and other events.

Outside of my daily work, I enjoy disc golf, bowling, snow skiing, board and video games, watching movies/TV and rock music/concerts. I can play multiple instruments including piano, trumpet, and guitar. I love Jesus and worship Him at [The Austin Stone Community Church](https://austinstone.org/).
